In medical management, more and more information technologies are applied to
improve work efficiency. For example, the hospital information management system
is used to carry out a patient’s basic information and medical management, the wrist
one-dimensional QR Code is employed to quickly read or input a patient’s identity (ID)
and so on.

Information technology brings convenience while at the same time there are
certain secure drawbacks in several typical scenarios because of immature technology or
management vulnerability, such as, the reports transparency leaks user privacy, access
to view the medical privacy record is not strictly controlled, infusion confirmation is
without technical authentication, patient wrist ID is easy to be forged, payment is not
convenient and so on. The security issues are further analyzed as follows.

Healthcare applications are considered as promising fields for wireless sensor networks, where patients can be monitored using wireless medical networks (WMNs).
This paper aims to provide a secure and easy way to distribute patient data to
various data servers. It also performs the Paillier cryptosystems to analyze the data
without compromising the privacy of the patient. 

The main contribution of this project
is to distribute patient’s data securely in data servers and performing the Paillier cryptosystems to perform statistical analysis on the patient data without compromising the
patient’s privacy.
